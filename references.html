                    The main coding language used was HTML, with the brief use of Java to code the search engine. Visual Studio Code was used to type up, test, and link code and pages, and Live Server was used to see updates to the code. Framework Bootstrap was used, but no templates for the tool were used. Github was used to upload and keep track of files, which were then uploaded through Github to Vercel for web hosting. Formspree was used to host the form submission. Photos were found either from their respective sites, or royalty-free from Unsplash. These photos were then edited on befunky.com, with the "Allegrya" font from their font catalogue. Additional fonts used were Bootstrap fonts such as "Display" and "Lead." ALthough some of these resources offer AI tools, absolutely NONE were used in our project.
